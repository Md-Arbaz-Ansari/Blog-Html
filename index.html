            <h2>
               1. My Adventure in Iceland
            </h2>
            <p>
                I recently fulfilled my dream of visiting Iceland! This fascinating country is a land of extremes-from glaciers and volcanoes to hot springs and lava field. Some highlights from my trip:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Hiked up to see the stunning Sk`ogafoss waterfall which drops 60m over a cliff.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Went snowmobiling on the Myrdalsjokull glacier under the moonlight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Relaxd in the warm, mineral-rich water of the Blue Lagoon geothermal spa.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Watched the mesmerizing Northem Lights dance across the night sky.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I found the Icelandic people to be friendly and welcoming. The country's natural scenery is out of this world. Exploring the volcanic landscape makes you feel like you're on another planet! I can't wait to return to Iceland someday.

               2. The Foodie's Guide to Italy
            </h2>

            <p>
                They say the best part of traveling in Italy is the food- and I wholeheartedly agree! Here are some highlights from my culinary adventure in Italy:
            </p>
            <img src="/Assets/Food italy.jfif" alt="Food image">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Tried traditional Neapolitan pizza with fresh buffalo mozzearella cheese and sweet San Marzano tomatoes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sampled the finest authentic pasta dishes like cacio e pepe, carbonara, and bolognese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Indulged in scoops of velvety gelato in vibrant flavors like pistachio, stracciatella, and tiramisu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sipped refreshing Aperol Spritz cocktails and Italian wines like Chianti in streetside cafes.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                From the Mediterranean-inspired cuisine of the south to the hearty meat and cheese dishes of the north, every region in Italy has something unique to offer. The Italians truly know how to cook from the heart and honor the freshest local ingredients. I can't wait to return and discover more regional specialties!

               3. Wine Tasting in France
            </h2>
            <p>
                I had a amazing time touring the vineyards and wineries of France! As a wine lover, it was a dream to visit some of the world's most renowned wine regions.
            </p>

            <p>
                In Bordeaux, I sampled incredible cabernets and Merlots while soaking in the charming <em>chateaux </em> and medieval villages along the river. In Burgundy, I biked around quaint towans and tasted dazzling pinot Noirs and Chardonnays. My favorite was Champagne, where touring the underground cellars and sipping bubbly was the perfect end to my wine adventures. 
            </p>

            <p>
                With its dedication to terroir and winemaking tradition, France offers an unparalled wine tourism experience. I can't wait to return and discover more hidden gems!
